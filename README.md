# Mission11_Assignment

I definitely forgot to put which attributes I used in the comments. So, if you still can give me points for the bootstrap stuff that would be nice, if not I get it. I didn't follow instructions very well.

But, if you care... I used the Toast Notifications for when you add a book to your cart. It's the little pop up at the bottom right hand corner of the screen. The code for that can be found in BookList.tsx.

Additionally, I used Tooltips to make the book rows more interactive. They make it so if you hover over the title it shows more details about the book. So if you wanted to ditch some of the columns that's a way that you could see the rest of the data. Also can be found in BookList.tsx.
